String Code Samples via C++ implementation

Background:
    The objective of these programs is to demonstrate a few simple
    string manipulations via C++ implementation. 

    This directory contains two coding samples:
    * palinedrome   - Prog tests user specified string for palindrome status
    * reverseString - Prog reverses user specified string via various methods 

Palindrome Program Description & Usage:
    This program tests and reports a commandline specified string is
    or is not a palindrome (a string which reads the same backwards as it
    does forwards - mamma is a palindrome, momma is NOT a palindrome.

    To test a string for palindrome, on the command line enter:
        ./palindrome your_string_to_test

    The program will print the result of the test to the display.
    
ReverseString Program Description & Usage:
    This program reverses a commandline specified string via various methods.

    To reverse a string, on the command line enter:
       ./reverseString your_string_to_reverse

    The program will print the original string, followed by the reverse method
    used and the resulting string.  The methods of reversal used are listed:
         * print string from the end using string end iterator
         * reverse string via standard library algorithm::reverse method
         * reverse string via standard library vector, rbegin to rend iterators
         * reverse string via use of standard library stack
         
To build:
    * make               - builds both executables (palindrome, reverseString)
    * make palindrome    - builds executable palindrome
    * make reverseString - builds executable reverseString

To execute:
    * ./palindrome myString_to_test  
    * ./reverseString myString_to_reverse    

To execute valgrind memory usage check:
    * make test_palindrome palString=your_string_to_test
    * make test_reverseString revString=your_string_to_reverse
    * make tests palString=your_string_test revString=your_string_to_reverse
